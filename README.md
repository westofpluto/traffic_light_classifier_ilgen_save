This repo contains the traffic light classifier code and data files I used to classify traffic lights as
part of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree capstone project. The network is based on Squeezenet and has
separate training data for the simulator and for the actual site. The image data files and a data augmentation
script are contained in the data folder. The ilgen-squeezenet folder contains the training and test code.
These should be run on a GPU machine (AWS instance) for best results.

This README is a work in progress, just quick and dirty for now.
